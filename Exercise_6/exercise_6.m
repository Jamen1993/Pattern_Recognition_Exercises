%
% In this exercise we want to find the model which best approximates an unknown Psychometric
% function. We know that the unknown Psychometric function is a displaced representation, in the
% [0,2] interval, of a basic psychometric function with threshold=4. We have 11 models whose
% displacement varies in the [0,2] interval with a step of 0.2. There are two ways of finding
% the best approximation.
%
% First we can get 20 samples for each small displacement (ex. dx=0.2) on x axis and calculate
% the % "correct' for each position. Then we find the Psychometric function that fits the best
% the salculated percentages.
%
% A more efficient approach to the problem is the use of Bayesian inferece (or learning) which
% iteratively converges to the best model. This algorithm can be summarized
% in the following steps:
%
% a. Assign equal weights to all models
% b. sample (get a response) at a random displacement in the [0,2] interval
% c. calculate new weights for each model (multiply old weights with the return probability of Psychometric function if sample=1 or 1-probability if sample=0)
% d. normalize new weights in order for then to sum to 1
% e. sample at the threshold of the model with the highest weight
% f. repeat from c
